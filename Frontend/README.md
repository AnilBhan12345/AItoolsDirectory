# AI Tools Directory (No-Code Friendly)

This is a ready-to-deploy Next.js website. You don't need to write any code.

## How to Publish (3 steps)

1. **Upload to GitHub**
   - Create a public repo (e.g., `ai-tools-directory`).
   - Upload all the files from this folder.

2. **Deploy on Vercel**
   - Go to vercel.com and sign in with GitHub.
   - Click **New Project** → choose your repo → **Deploy**.
   - Done! Your site will be live with a `.vercel.app` link.

3. **Edit content (optional)**
   - The tool list is in `app/page.js` inside `MOCK_TOOLS`.
   - You can change names, descriptions, and links there.
   - Later, replace with a real API endpoint to auto-update.

## Local Run (optional)
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```
